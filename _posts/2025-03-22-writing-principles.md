## Motivation

We write to communicate and to document. The two purposes are achieved through
the following writing activities that I actively engage in as a graduate
student.

| Category        | Purpose                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **School**      | To ask for clarification via email                          |
|                 | To discuss assignments with colleagues                      |
|                 | To document course notes                                    |
|                 | To persuade graders for partial credits                     |
| **Opportunity** | To apply for jobs, grants, fellowships, scholarships        |
| **Research**    | To draft a research paper and submit an abstract for review |
|                 | To email collaborators across different time zones          |
|                 | To document code                                            |
| **Daily**       | To plan a day and write a diary                             |
|                 | To communicate with family and friends                      |

In the above activities, good writing has the following benefits

1. minimizes misunderstanding between the reader and the writer.
2. reduces mental strain required for comprehension and recollection.
3. maintains the reader's attention.

Now, what is considered "good writing"?

## "Good writing" definition

Good writing to me has the three components in order: (1) clarity (2)
conciseness, and (3) neutrality. While the first two are self-explanatory, the
term "neurality" is important at the human-level.

We want to evalute whether our writing is remains non-hostile. A good test would
be, would my parents and advisors proud? If the answer is no, I do not write.

## Writing guide with examples

We want to write a little as possible while maintaining a positive interaction
with the reader. Good writing does not mean we write everything in "I am XYZ",
"I do this, I do that". Good writing continues to capture the attention of the
reader.

Good writing is a not s single definition but a writing style that addresses the
core principles above.

I created the examples unless cited.

### 1. Prioritize importance in order

The following example is appropriate for a personal planner or a writer
reporting to a superior:

```md
# 1. Original

I am going to be writing two articles by the end of the day.

# 2. Improved

I will submit two articles to the front desk by 6 pm.

# 3. My choice

By 6 pm, I will submit two articles to the front desk.
```

#### Rationale

- **Reduce phrase ambiguity**. "By the end of the day" can be 11:59 pm or after
  business hours. "6 pm" is clear and concise.
- **Add a clear action cycle**. Instead of "going to be writing", a writer
  submits a paper if that was the intention. Professionals deliver results, and
  we want to know the location.
- **Prioritize time.** As a writer, time is key; therefore, "6 pm" is moved to
  the front. The superior wants to know the specific time.

Now the superior expects an email by 6 pm. The superior and I save time without.
No extra email for a clarification on submission time.

### 2. Distill to improve clarity

A long sentence is not required to describe a concept or instruct the reader.

In chemical engineering, distillation is a process of boiling a mixture to
extract a desirable a compound. The captured compound as a vapor is pure and
clear. Sentences and paragraphs are like the mixture. It must be distilled
before we serve to the reader.

In writing, the process of "distillation" follows whehter I have abided by the
three components above.

```md
It is quite significant. -> It is significant.
```

### 3. Avoid colloquialism for documentation

Surgeons avoid miscommunication such as using "correct" instead of "right" to
prevent ambiguity. Although colloquaial itself is not bad, but in the context of
academic and professional writing such as writing academic papers, it is best to
be avoided because we want to avoid ambiguitty and dual meanings at all if
possible. We want to separate body movements from academic writing.

```md
See Figure 5 -> Refer to Figure 5 It can be seen that from the above paragraph
-> As Pointed out -> "Clearly, one can see that" ->
```

### 4. Minimize conjunctions

I try to minimize the use of "However", "But", "And", etc. to improve
storytelling. These conjunctions although serve its purpose, it often creates a
pause bewteen the two connecting sentences and phrases, hindering the natural
flow. I use it. But I generally do not use it unless the intention is to provide
a shift and abrupt change in the argument processs.
