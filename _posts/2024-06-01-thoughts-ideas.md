### Writing principles

A sentence is ordered based on priority. For example, if the purpose is to write an outline of the overall paper, then instead of writing, "The role of titanium is discussed in the first section," I write, "First, we discuss the role of titanium."

A sentence requires precise words to avoid miscommunication. In fields such as the military and medicine, professionals avoid colloquial words. Surgeons use the term "correct" instead of "right" during procedures. I recently rewrote "Find the number of atoms in a formula" to "Count unique elements in a chemical formula." In this context, "formula" could refer to a mathematical formula, and "Find the number" is replaced with "count." "Elements" refers to unique atom types.

A sentence is abridged with the correct noun-verb pair. Adjectives describe nouns, and adverbs describe verbs. Adjectives and adverbs may not be necessary when the noun-verb pair adequately conveys the meaning.

A sentence should not start with symbols. If an acronym is unfamiliar to the audience, the full name should be used multiple times.

### Purpose of research

In crystallography and solid-state science, in particular, research serves to (1) discover new substances with potential utility, (2) propose methods, and (3) characterize the underlying structure and phenomena with a category such as space group.

Here, the unifying theme is to produce new knowledge. The main difference between humans and others is our ability to store and retrieve generational knowledge across time and space. Hence, the production and propagation of knowledge is a uniquely human activity. This activity equips us with the materials and methods to become the most powerful species.

In contrast, this very knowledge also equips us with the capacity to destroy ourselves. Laws, regulations, and orders impose boundaries on individuals, organizations, and nations. The boundaries prevent the misuse of power derived from this knowledge. This is evident in recent history, particularly from the 1940s onwards. Hence, research is a sacred activity; it is a human activity, aimed at advancing our civilization by producing new knowledge.

### "Good luck!" 

I favor the word "serendipity" over "luck." Both words signify an unexpected beneficial outcome. They differ in terms of self-direction and initiation. The well-known explorer isn't merely lucky to discover new lands. I am not merely lucky to have crossed the Pacific Ocean to be in one of the lands. I decided to be here. Yes, I do not neglect what I was provided with. Nonetheless, serendipity carries a degree of will.

As a student, serendipity is the occurrence of exam problems I've solved several times before. As a researcher, it's the moment I figure out how to optimize data structures and create incredible figures with Matplotlib, or when I discover open-source code that helps me learn computing with matrices. As a writer, it's the moment when just a pair of a noun and a verb forms a better sentence. The term "serendipity" encapsulates this sense of self-initiative and direction towards solving a problem. So, when I say "Good luck," it has a meaningful context too.
