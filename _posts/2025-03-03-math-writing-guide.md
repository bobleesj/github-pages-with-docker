Within Text: If an equation is part of a sentence or ends a sentence, you should treat it as any other word in the sentence and use appropriate punctuation.

## Math
- Sentences shall not begin with a symbol
- No use of "if and only if"
- Avoid "Clearly" "Obviously" to start a sentence. Use "It follows directly from this definition that", etc.
